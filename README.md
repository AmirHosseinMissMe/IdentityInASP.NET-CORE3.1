This an full authentication system in ASP.NET Core3.1.

### Features of authentication system:

* Using DBContext

* CRUD Operations(CREATE_READ_UPDATE_DELETE)

* SignUp Page

* Login Page

* LogOut

* Using Task for asynchronous operations(Multi Task)

* Email Confirmation

* Translated Error

* Remote Validation and some Security points about that

* Google login

* User Management

* Role, CRUD operation on Roles, Addiing Users to Roles, and Remove Users from Roles

* Role-based Authorization

### What to do?

If you want to use it on your system, you can easily use VisualStudio to compile and  run the project.

Remember to change `Connection String` in `appsetting.json` and also make migrations for Database using:
```

Add_Migration /* Migration Name */

Update_Database

```

Also you can run project without VisualStudio. You can easily run it using terminal or command line and this command:

```

dotnet run

```
